It's March 13, 2024 at 10:29 AM and I'm following The Odin Project to guide myself in creating our Capstone 1 system. It's going to take a long time and I might be behind everyone else, but I think it's going to be worth itâ€“following a somewhat professional-level course. 

    I want to make our Capstone 1 system as good as it gets. I'm going to be ahead everyone else.
