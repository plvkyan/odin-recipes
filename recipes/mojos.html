        <p> Potato mojos are a crispy and addictive appetizer or side dish made with thick-cut potato slices. They are battered or dredged in a seasoned coating, then deep-fried until golden brown and delicious. Mojos are famous for their contrast of a fluffy potato interior with a satisfyingly crunchy exterior. </p>
